# Basic HTML boilerplate
The basic HTML5 boilerplate code looks like this:

```html
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <title>Your Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Your content goes here -->

</body>
</html>
```

## Boilerplate improved

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Your Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Your content goes here -->

</body>
</html>
```

This is a simple template that includes the necessary HTML5 document structure with the standard `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` elements. It also includes the character set meta tag, viewport meta tag for responsive design, and a title for your webpage.
